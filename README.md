# Python-Web
This project consists of two parts:
* Web page.
* Python script

What is for ?
- In order to make your changes on your linux server without login to the server.
- An HTML page.
- GUI.

How it happens?

The HTML page contains a jumboframe for output results from your linux server or you can add an input attributes.
After modifing your web page, you configuring your buttons to send the data directly to a python script on the server that takes the input valus and insert them into a variable. 
From here things became easy and you can play with the data how ever you want.

Enjoy.
