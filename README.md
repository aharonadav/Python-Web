# Python-Web
This project consists of two parts:
* Web page.
* Python script

What is for ?
- In order to make your changes on your linux server without login to the server.
- An HTML page.
- GUI.

How it happens?

The HTML page contains a jumboframe for output results from your linux server or you can add an input attributes.
After modifing your web page, you configuring your buttons to send the data directly to a python script on the server that takes the input valus and insert them into a variable. 
From here things became easy and you can play with the data how ever you want.

Bonus!!
You can use the "MyButtin" id to run any script that you have on your server by changing the shell_exec file (script.php) name to the script you want to run by clicking the button on your web page.


Enjoy.
